# Encryption Methods 

## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort developed by a team of classmates to create an interactive web application showcasing various symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods. The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using different cryptographic techniques, providing an educational and practical experience with encryption.

## Features
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Examples include AES, DES, and Triple DES.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Examples include RSA and ECC.
- Interactive interface to input plaintext and view the encrypted ciphertext.
- Visual explanations of encryption methods and algorithms.
- Support for customizable encryption keys.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- Educate users about encryption methods and their differences.
- Demonstrate the practical applications of cryptography in securing messages.
- Highlight the strengths and weaknesses of various encryption techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (e.g., Flask, Django) or Node.js
- **Encryption Libraries**: 
  - Python: `cryptography`, `PyCrypto` or similar
  - JavaScript: `crypto` or third-party libraries like `crypto-js`
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Usage
1. Navigate to the homepage of the web application.
2. Choose an encryption method from the list (e.g., AES, RSA).
3. Input your message in the provided text box.
4. (Optional) Provide a custom encryption key if applicable.
5. Click on "Encrypt" to view the encrypted message.
6. Use the "Decrypt" option to revert the ciphertext back to plaintext

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: Contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the UI.
- `backend/`: Contains server-side code and API endpoints.
- `encryption_methods/`: Directory for encryption algorithm implementations.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for the application.
